## Description
This is a project I created for my Web Techniques class at UniBuc FMI.

## Setting the project up
0. VS Code is the IDE I used to work on this project, thus I recommend using it.
1. In VS Code's terminal, write `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to download all the necessary node modules.
2. After the node modules have been downloaded, write `npm start` to generate all the dist files and create a localhost server.
